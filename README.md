# Register of licensed aerodromes

The Civil Aviation Authority licenses aerodromes.  The licenses are
[published](https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-industry/Airports/Aerodrome-licences/Licences/Aerodrome-licences-and-boundary-maps/)
in pdf format with tables and maps.  This repo extracts the licence number and
aerodrome name from the pdf files.
